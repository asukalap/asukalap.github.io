      <p>
        You are a freelance web designer helping an organization, Minimalism At Its Finest, update their website. The company comes to you with a cluttered site: dense blocks of text, more colours and fonts than you can count on your one hand and too many pieces of media.
      </p>
      <p>
        They tell you that they want a “minimalist” look. Using the definition of minimalism and the information presented today, rebrand and “declutter” the company’s website. Minimalism At Its Finest has given you free reign. You may use any colours, fonts and media of your liking as long as it portrays minimalism! You are allowed to change the HTML as you deem fit.
        <br>Remember: You have one hour to complete this. Sometimes less is more!
