      <p>
        You are a freelance web designer helping a company named [company name] rebrand and update their website. The company comes to you with a cluttered site: long, dense paragraphs, more colours and fonts than you can count on your one hand and way too many pieces of media.
      </p>
      <p>
        They tell you that they want to rebrand completely and want a “minimalist” look. Using the definition of minimalism you learnt and information presented today, rebrand and “declutter” the company’s website. [Company name] has given you free reign. You may use any colours, fonts and media of your liking as long as it portrays minimalism! You are allowed to change the HTML as you deem fit.
