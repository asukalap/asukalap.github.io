  If I were to design the website for this restaurant, I imagine it being an Italian restaurant. I would use elegant scripts for titles and serif fonts for the body to give it a classic feel. For instance, the Google font Satisfy would make a beautiful headings font.
  It would have brown and red colours to give a warm feel and simulate colours from a wood oven.
  There would be well framed and lit images of the food taken by professional photographers as well as reviews from people on social media and their images of the restaurant's food under a "Fan Favourites" section.
  The background would be either a gradient going from red to yellow or a wooden pattern.
